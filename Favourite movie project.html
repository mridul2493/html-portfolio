    <h1>The Best Movies According to Mridul</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Extraction 2 </h3>
    <p> One of the best action movies ever watched. <br>
        Direction of movie and plot is great.</p>
    <h3>John Wick Franchise</h3>
    <p>        All the four parts are full of action. <br>
        4th part is amazing and best thriller ever watched.</p>
    <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>        the crime elements are peripheral and there's 
        <br>more humor than one might find in a typical thriller.</p>
